<p>Before jumping into cooking, we need the right tools. We need to bootstrap your kitchen, so module 1 will require the most tools up front. Future modules will rarely require more than 1 or 2 new tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book tries to assume very few prerequisites. However, we will assume you have at least a small “kitchen” area with a sink, a refrigerator, and a stovetop. If you don’t have a refrigerator (not recommended), you’ll have to go shopping immediately before cooking. If you don’t have a stovetop, you’ll need to purchase a portable one (for example, <a href="https://amzn.asia/d/fZUZ70N">an induction cooktop</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acquire each tool and check the box next to it on this page. We’ve provided recommended links to fit your budget and enthusiasm, but almost anything you find will work fine. Note: all links assume you live in Japan.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online</strong>: So you don’t have to leave the house. Allow some time for delivery!</li>
<li><strong>Store</strong>: If you prefer buying in-person, these are links to stores commonly found in major cities around Japan.</li>
<li><strong>Cheap</strong>: Buy this version if you’re on a budget or not ready to invest. Expect to replace these tools sooner than later on your cooking journey. For in-store, check a ¥100 store like <a href="https://jp.daisonet.com/">Daiso</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Reasonable</strong>: A good balance of quality and price. We recommend <a href="https://www.nitori-net.jp/ec/">Nitori</a> for low-end reasonable and <a href="https://www.muji.com/jp/ja/store">Muji</a> for high-end reasonable.</li>
<li><strong>Timeless</strong>: For those that live the motto “Go big or go home”. When cared for properly (we’ll help), these tools should become lifetime cooking companions.</li>

<h1 id="shopping-beginners-guide">Shopping: beginner’s guide</h1>
<p>This section is about getting you comfortable finding and navigating a supermarket in Japan so you can get to the fun part (cooking).</p>
<p>For 3-times-daily cooks in Japan cooking for a family, it’s common to visit the supermarket every day. As your cooking journey progresses, you may find yourself wanting to do the same. However, for now, we’ll try to ease you into cooking by only requiring a trip once every 2 weeks or so.</p>
<h2 id="supermarket-types">Supermarket types</h2>
<p>The distribution and variety of supermarkets will be different in cities and rural areas. There are a few conglomerates that own most supermarket chains. However, it’s best to consider them by a few common size buckets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convenience store</strong>: Besides junk food and prepared meals, convenience stores often have a small section of semi-prepared fresh vegetables, eggs, milk, etc. that can be useful in a bind. Common seasonings like vegetable oil, soy sauce, etc. as well. We recommend visiting a few of your neighborhood conbinis to check their inventory.
<ul>
<li>Examples: 7-Eleven, Family Mart, Lawson</li>
<li>TODO: photo</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hole-in-the-wall</strong>: Tiny produce-only (vegetables/fruits) neighborhood stores. Generally these will be a bit cheaper and fresher. Don’t hesitate to stop by when you only need to restock your fresh foodstuffs.</li>
<li><strong>2-aisle</strong>: This type is about the size of a big convenience store. It will have one or two choices for main staples and seasonings, a small selection of common produce, and a small selection of raw meats (alongside frozen food, drinks, etc.). These stores do not have any in-house food preparation. You can certainly make do shopping at these stores, but for freshness and variety, we recommend shopping at at least mid-size stores.
<ul>
<li>Examples: My Basket, maruetsu petit, mini Piago, Seijoishii, Lawson 100</li>
<li>TODO: photo</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mid-size</strong>: Mid-size stores usually have a comfortable variety of fresh food and seasonings. They have (small) in-house food preparation departments. An advanced cook might sometimes feel a bit constrained by the selection, but in general this size can be the regular option for everyday cooking.
<ul>
<li>Examples: Peacock store, Life, Tokyu store</li>
<li>TODO: photo</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Full-size</strong>: Full-size stores have all varieties of produce you’ve heard of and many you haven’t. The meat and fish selection is huge. In addition to in-house food preparation, there’s also a bakery. Specialty foods and imported foods are common. Prices will generally be lower too. The only downside is that the variety can be overwhelming to new cooks.
<ul>
<li>Examples: Aeon, Cost-co</li>
<li>TODO: photo</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>All things equal, you should try to do most of your shopping at mid-size and full-size stores, with 2-aisle and convenience stores only in a pinch. However, you can still do great cooking from any of these sources.</p>
<p>There are also several online supermarket delivery options. However, these will more difficult to navigate with limited Japanese language ability. It’s also harder to see your buying options at a glance and develop the ability to pick the freshest produce. For now, we’ll assume you can visit a physical store.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-a-supermarket">Navigating a supermarket</h2>
<p>Start by searching for supermarkets around your home. You can also try searching for some of the example store names above. Judging by the pictures, try to find one in the mid-size or full-size category. When walking around your neighborhood, keep an eye out for hole-in-the-wall produce shops that might not have an internet presence.</p>
<p>Read through the template and ideas in this module and pick out which foodstuffs look most delicious to you.</p>
<p>For your shopping list, use the checklist in this website’s sidebar for this module. Get all the seasonings on your first trip, but you can always plan to go back later for more foodstuffs.</p>
<p>On entering, you’ll find a stack of hand baskets. Grab one. In full-size stores, you’ll find metal push carts you can put the basket in.</p>
<p>First, locate the produce section. Some produce will be chilled in open-air refrigerators and the rest will be nearby. Usually this will be on an outer wall of the store.</p>
<p>Mid-size stores and above may have organic and regular varieties of produce on separate shelves. Organic will be sometimes be labeled オーガニック. Or you can tell by comparing prices (organic is more expensive).</p>
<p>Some produce will be pre-wrapped. For others (e.g. broccoli) you’ll need to find the rolls of thin, clear plastic bags and tear one off. Carefully bag your selected vegetable and place it in your basket.</p>
<p>Next, move on to the non-refrigerated aisles towards the center of the store to find seasonings. Each store will be arranged and grouped differently so we can’t give exact directions. But we’ve included representative photos of each seasoning and foodstuff so, worst case, you can show the photo to staff.</p>
<p>TODO: common Japanese phrasing for talking to stuff (footnote?)</p>
<p>As you progress through the modules, you’ll become more familiar with your local store and how ingredients are related, and the process of finding new ingredients will become easier.</p>
<p>Make sure you’re only buying an amount you’re capable of transporting home. Some ingredients will be heavy, especially if you’re walking long distances.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s time to pay. Some stores (usually 2-aisle) will have a mix of self-registers. We’ll assume you can find a human cashier.</p>
<p>The cashier will take your basket and beginning scanning items. They’ll transfer each item to a separate colored basket that corresponds to “paid”.</p>
<p>The cashier will ask you after taking your basket or right before accepting payment whether you need a bag. You’ll need to pay ~¥5 per bag.</p>
<p>TODO: Japanese for getting a bag (footnote?)</p>
<p>Chain stores of all sizes will accept almost all forms of payment. However, you may want to bring cash your first time just in case.</p>
<p>Once you’ve paid, you can take your new basket to a nearby table area to transfer your groceries to the plastic bags. In the bagging area there will be a roll of thin, clear plastic bags you can use (for free) to wrap trays of meat to protect against leaks on your way home.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You survived your first shopping trip. It only gets easier from here.</p>
<h1 id="shopping-seasonings">Shopping: seasonings</h1>
<p>TODO: total cost</p>
<p>Seasonings will generally be bought less often than foodstuffs. Once you have a nice “library” of seasonings, you’ll usually replace them irregularly as they run out. When you notice one is getting low, make sure to add it to your shopping list for next time.</p>
<p>You’ll buy seasonings alongside foodstuffs on regular trips to the supermarket.</p>
<h2 id="olive-oil-オリーブオイル">Olive oil オリーブオイル</h2>
<p>TODO: photo</p>
<p>Olive oil is used for both seasoning and cooking. It has more taste than neutral oils like vegetable oil, therefore you can find a larger variety of qualities and prices. In the future, you may want to start a small collection of more expensive types for garnishing uses where its taste will take a front row like drizzling on pasta.</p>
<p>There are several types of olive oil. You should <strong>start with “extra virgin”</strong>.</p>
<p>~450g is a common bottle size, but feel free to start out with ~200g.</p>
<p>All olive oil will go rancid eventually, but you can keep it fresher longer by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preferring a dark glass bottle (instead of a clear plastic bottle).</li>
<li>Store the bottle out of direct sunlight.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vinegar-酢">Vinegar 酢</h2>
<p>TODO: photo</p>
<p>Vinegar is a seasoning that adds acidity. It also removes the smell of food and softens it.</p>
<h2 id="salt-塩">Salt 塩</h2>
<p>TODO: photo</p>
<p>Salt is the most basic seasoning. It is also effective in removing water from food and removing odors. There are many kinds for many purposes, but for now we’ll start with table salt.</p>
<p>Buy a shaker-type container at first. When you run out, buy a small bag and refill the container.</p>
<h2 id="sugar-砂糖">Sugar 砂糖</h2>
<p>TODO: photo</p>
<p>Sugar is a seasoning that gives sweetness. It also softens food. Look for white sugar shirozatou 白砂糖 (also called caster sugar jyouhakutou 上白糖).</p>
<h2 id="black-pepper-胡椒">Black pepper 胡椒</h2>
<p>TODO: photo</p>
<p>Pepper is a spice characterized by its pungent taste. It adds an accent to dishes and also removes the odor of meat and fish. It’s sold as raw peppercorn and pre-ground varieties. At first, buy a small shaker of pre-ground black pepper. Later in your journey, we’ll recommend buying peppercorns and a grinder for the freshest taste.</p>
